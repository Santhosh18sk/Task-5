# ðŸš¢ Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook to uncover patterns in passenger survival. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and extracting key insights from the dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The dataset contains passenger details from the Titanic disaster, including:
- **PassengerId** â€“ Unique ID for each passenger
- **Pclass** â€“ Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name** â€“ Passenger's full name
- **Sex** â€“ Gender
- **Age** â€“ Age in years
- **SibSp** â€“ Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch** â€“ Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket** â€“ Ticket number
- **Fare** â€“ Passenger fare
- **Cabin** â€“ Cabin number
- **Embarked** â€“ Port of embarkation
- **Survived** â€“ Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) *(only in train set)*

Files included:
- `train.csv`
- `test.csv`
- `gender_submission.csv`

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Steps in the Analysis
1. **Load Data** â€“ Read CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Understand Data** â€“ Use `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to explore.
3. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handle missing values and correct data types.
4. **Exploratory Analysis** â€“ Analyze relationships between survival and features.
5. **Visualization** â€“ Create plots for survival rates by gender, class, and age.
6. **Insights Extraction** â€“ Summarize findings from visualizations.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- **Women** had a much higher survival rate compared to men.
- **1st class** passengers had the highest chance of survival.
- **Younger** passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Fare price** had a positive correlation with survival.
- Passengers embarking from **Cherbourg** had higher survival rates.
